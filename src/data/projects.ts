		description: `In two days, I led a team of 5 to develop a solution called “TickETH”, an NFT Ticketing Platform built with Ethereum, Hardhat, Next.js, and PostgreSQL. Our platform TickETH allows event organizers to deploy their smart contracts and manage events directly through our dashboard UI. At the same time, ticket buyers can easily browse through events and buy tickets in the form of NFTs.`,
